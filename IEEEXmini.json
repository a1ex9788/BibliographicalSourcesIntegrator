      "abstract": "In this paper, a RF front-end of the 5.8 GHz integrated CMOS dedicated short range communication (DSRC) transceiver for the Korea/Japan electronic toll collection system is presented. The receiver uses low-IF conversion architecture for high sensitivity and low-power consumption while the transmitter uses direct up-conversion architecture for its simple structure and reliability. To solve image problem in the low-IF receiver, 10 MHz IF and 40 MHz IF are chosen for Korean and Japanese DSRC standards, respectively, since they make no image signals exist in image band. A single-quadrature mixer with the proposed transconductor-type quadrature generator in RF signal path is also adopted which has accurate quadrature characteristic in 5.8 GHz frequency. When the RF front-end of the integrated 5.8 GHz DSRC transceiver is implemented using 0.13 μm CMOS technology, the receiver achieves the overall noise figure of less than 5 dB with image rejection ratio of more than 30 dB, and the transmitter carries an output peak power of 10 dBm with the adjacent channel power ratio of -43 dBc. The RF front-end of the 5.8 GHz DSRC transceiver dissipates 45 mA with 1.2 V supply voltage and 142 mA with 1.2/3.3 V dual supply voltage during RXand TX-modes, respectively.",

In the gossip algorithms, in each time slot, each node communicates with a neighboring node, which is randomly selected by an Exchange algorithm, to exchange their information. The goal of the algorithm is to efficiently disseminate all the messages to all the nodes as fast as possible. We analyze the convergence time of network coding (NC) based gossip algorithm by taking into account the node mobility in MANETs, and derived a lower bound on the convergence time. It showed that the convergence time of the NC gossip algorithm with node mobility can be reduced by the order of O(n1/2/log3/2n) over that without considering node mobility. But it is only O(log n) quicker than the gossip algorithm with node mobility but no NC.",

      "abstract": "Efficient rescue task scheduling plays a key role in disaster rescue operations. In real-world applications, such an emergency scheduling problem often involves multiple objectives, complex constraints, inherent uncertainty, and limited response time requirement. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy multiobjective optimization problem of rescue task scheduling, the aim of which is to simultaneously maximize the task scheduling efficiency and minimize the operation risk for the rescue team. We then develop an efficient multiobjective biogeography-based optimization (EMOBBO) algorithm for solving the problem. To cope with the uncertainty, we employ three correlated fuzzy ranking criteria, and use the concept of fuzzy dominance for comparing the dominance relation of solutions. In EMOBBO, we define new migration and mutation operators for effectively evolving the permutation-based solutions, use a problem-specific solution rearrangement mechanism for filtering out inefficient solutions, and employ a local neighborhood structure to suppress premature convergence. Computational experiments show that the proposed EMOBBO algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms, and our algorithm has been successfully applied to several real-world disaster rescue operations in recent years.",

      "abstract": "In systems neuroscience, it is becoming increasingly common to record the activity of hundreds of neurons simultaneously via electrode arrays. The ability to accurately measure the causal interactions among multiple neurons in the brain is crucial to understanding how neurons work in concert to generate specific brain functions. The development of new statistical methods for assessing causal influence between spike trains is still an active field of neuroscience research. Here, we suggest a copula-based Granger causality measure for the analysis of neural spike train data. This method is built upon our recent work on copula Granger causality for the analysis of continuous-valued time series by extending it to point-process neural spike train data. The proposed method is therefore able to reveal nonlinear and high-order causality in the spike trains while retaining all the computational advantages such as model-free, efficient estimation, and variability assessment of Granger causality. The performance of our algorithm can be further boosted with time-reversed data. Our method performed well on extensive simulations, and was then demonstrated on neural activity simultaneously recorded from primary visual cortex of a monkey performing a contour detection task.",

      "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an intricate network that pervades the entire cortex of plant cells and its geometric shape undergoes drastic changes. This paper proposes a mathematical model to reconstruct geometric network dynamics by combining the node movements within the network and topological changes engendered by these nodes. The network topology in the model is determined by a modified optimization procedure from the work (Lemarchand, et al. 2014) which minimizes the total length taking into account both degree and angle constraints, beyond the conditions of connectedness and planarity. A novel feature for solving our optimization problem is the use of “lifted” angle constraints, which allows one to considerably reduce the solution runtimes. Using this optimization technique and a Langevin approach for the branching node movement, the simulated network dynamics represent the ER network dynamics observed under latrunculin B treated condition and recaptures features such as the appearance/disappearance of loops within the ER under the native condition. The proposed modeling approach allows quantitative comparison of networks between the model and experimental data based on topological changes induced by node dynamics. An increased temporal resolution of experimental data will allow a more detailed comparison of network dynamics using this modeling approach.",

Secret Sharing, a cryptographic primitive for the distribution of a secret among a group of n participants designed so that only subsets of shareholders of cardinality 0 <; t ≤ n are allowed to reconstruct the secret by pooling their shares, can help mitigating and minimizing the problem. A desirable feature of Secret Sharing schemes is cheater detection, i.e., the ability to detect one or more malicious shareholders trying to reconstruct the secret by obtaining legal shares from the other shareholders while providing them with fake shares. Verifiable Secret Sharing schemes solve this problem by allowing shareholders verifying the others' shares. We present new verification algorithms providing arbitrary secret sharing schemes with cheater detection capabilities, and prove their space efficiency with regard to other schemes appeared in the literature. We also introduce, in one of our schemes, the Exponentiating Polynomial Root Problem (EPRP), which is believed to be NP-Intermediate and therefore difficult.",

In this paper, we focus on the performance optimization of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) using the meta-scheduling paradigm to achieve an improved job scheduling across multiple clouds. We propose a novel inter-cloud job scheduling framework and implement policies to optimize performance of participating clouds. The framework, named as Inter-Cloud Meta-Scheduling (ICMS), is based on a novel message exchange mechanism to allow optimization of job scheduling metrics. The resulting system offers improved flexibility, robustness and decentralization. We implemented a toolkit named “Simulating the Inter-Cloud” (SimIC) to perform the design and implementation of different inter-cloud entities and policies in the ICMS framework. An experimental analysis is produced for job executions in inter-cloud and a performance is presented for a number of parameters such as job execution, makespan, and turnaround times. The results highlight that the overall performance of individual clouds for selected parameters and configuration is improved when these are brought together under the proposed ICMS framework.",

The data compromise may occur due to attacks by other users and nodes within the cloud. Therefore, high security measures are required to protect data within the cloud. However, the employed security strategy must also take into account the optimization of the data retrieval time. In this paper, we propose division and replication of data in the cloud for optimal performance and security (DROPS) that collectively approaches the security and performance issues. In the DROPS methodology, we divide a file into fragments, and replicate the fragmented data over the cloud nodes. Each of the nodes stores only a single fragment of a particular data file that ensures that even in case of a successful attack, no meaningful information is revealed to the attacker. Moreover, the nodes storing the fragments, are separated with certain distance by means of graph T-coloring to prohibit an attacker of guessing the locations of the fragments. Furthermore, the DROPS methodology does not rely on the traditional cryptographic techniques for the data security; thereby relieving the system of computationally expensive methodologies. We show that the probability to locate and compromise all of the nodes storing the fragments of a single file is extremely low. We also compare the performance of the DROPS methodology with 10 other schemes. The higher level of security with slight performance overhead was observed.",

The fault detection consists of an innovations filter followed by a fault certification step, and requires no knowledge about the possible system faults. The innovations filter uses the optimal Boolean state estimator, called the Boolean Kalman Filter (BKF). In the presence of knowledge about the possible system faults, we propose an additional step of fault diagnosis based on a multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) method consisting of a bank of BKFs running in parallel. Performance is assessed by means of false detection and misdiagnosis rates, as well as average times until correct detection and diagnosis. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is demonstrated via numerical experiments using a p53-MDM2 negative feedback loop Boolean network with stuck-at faults that model molecular events commonly found in cancer.",
