      "abstract":"In this paper, a RF front-end of the 5.8 GHz integrated CMOS dedicated short range communication (DSRC) transceiver for the Korea/Japan electronic toll collection system is presented. The receiver uses low-IF conversion architecture for high sensitivity and low-power consumption while the transmitter uses direct up-conversion architecture for its simple structure and reliability. To solve image problem in the low-IF receiver, 10 MHz IF and 40 MHz IF are chosen for Korean and Japanese DSRC standards, respectively, since they make no image signals exist in image band. A single-quadrature mixer with the proposed transconductor-type quadrature generator in RF signal path is also adopted which has accurate quadrature characteristic in 5.8 GHz frequency. When the RF front-end of the integrated 5.8 GHz DSRC transceiver is implemented using 0.13 μm CMOS technology, the receiver achieves the overall noise figure of less than 5 dB with image rejection ratio of more than 30 dB, and the transmitter carries an output peak power of 10 dBm with the adjacent channel power ratio of -43 dBc. The RF front-end of the 5.8 GHz DSRC transceiver dissipates 45 mA with 1.2 V supply voltage and 142 mA with 1.2/3.3 V dual supply voltage during RXand TX-modes, respectively.",

      "abstract":"In this letter, we investigate the performance of algebraic gossip algorithms for information dissemination in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). In the gossip algorithms, in each time slot, each node communicates with a neighboring node, which is randomly selected by an Exchange algorithm, to exchange their information. The goal of the algorithm is to efficiently disseminate all the messages to all the nodes as fast as possible. We analyze the convergence time of network coding (NC) based gossip algorithm by taking into account the node mobility in MANETs, and derived a lower bound on the convergence time. It showed that the convergence time of the NC gossip algorithm with node mobility can be reduced by the order of O(n1/2/log3/2n) over that without considering node mobility. But it is only O(log n) quicker than the gossip algorithm with node mobility but no NC.",

      "abstract":"Efficient rescue task scheduling plays a key role in disaster rescue operations. In real-world applications, such an emergency scheduling problem often involves multiple objectives, complex constraints, inherent uncertainty, and limited response time requirement. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy multiobjective optimization problem of rescue task scheduling, the aim of which is to simultaneously maximize the task scheduling efficiency and minimize the operation risk for the rescue team. We then develop an efficient multiobjective biogeography-based optimization (EMOBBO) algorithm for solving the problem. To cope with the uncertainty, we employ three correlated fuzzy ranking criteria, and use the concept of fuzzy dominance for comparing the dominance relation of solutions. In EMOBBO, we define new migration and mutation operators for effectively evolving the permutation-based solutions, use a problem-specific solution rearrangement mechanism for filtering out inefficient solutions, and employ a local neighborhood structure to suppress premature convergence. Computational experiments show that the proposed EMOBBO algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms, and our algorithm has been successfully applied to several real-world disaster rescue operations in recent years.",

      "abstract":"In systems neuroscience, it is becoming increasingly common to record the activity of hundreds of neurons simultaneously via electrode arrays. The ability to accurately measure the causal interactions among multiple neurons in the brain is crucial to understanding how neurons work in concert to generate specific brain functions. The development of new statistical methods for assessing causal influence between spike trains is still an active field of neuroscience research. Here, we suggest a copula-based Granger causality measure for the analysis of neural spike train data. This method is built upon our recent work on copula Granger causality for the analysis of continuous-valued time series by extending it to point-process neural spike train data. The proposed method is therefore able to reveal nonlinear and high-order causality in the spike trains while retaining all the computational advantages such as model-free, efficient estimation, and variability assessment of Granger causality. The performance of our algorithm can be further boosted with time-reversed data. Our method performed well on extensive simulations, and was then demonstrated on neural activity simultaneously recorded from primary visual cortex of a monkey performing a contour detection task.",

This paper proposes a mathematical model to reconstruct geometric network dynamics by combining the node movements within the network and topological changes engendered by these nodes. The network topology in the model is determined by a modified optimization procedure from the work (Lemarchand, et al. 2014) which minimizes the total length taking into account both degree and angle constraints, beyond the conditions of connectedness and planarity. A novel feature for solving our optimization problem is the use of “lifted” angle constraints, which allows one to considerably reduce the solution runtimes. Using this optimization technique and a Langevin approach for the branching node movement, the simulated network dynamics represent the ER network dynamics observed under latrunculin B treated condition and recaptures features such as the appearance/disappearance of loops within the ER under the native condition. The proposed modeling approach allows quantitative comparison of networks between the model and experimental data based on topological changes induced by node dynamics. An increased temporal resolution of experimental data will allow a more detailed comparison of network dynamics using this modeling approach.",

Secret Sharing, a cryptographic primitive for the distribution of a secret among a group of n participants designed so that only subsets of shareholders of cardinality 0 <; t ≤ n are allowed to reconstruct the secret by pooling their shares, can help mitigating and minimizing the problem. A desirable feature of Secret Sharing schemes is cheater detection, i.e., the ability to detect one or more malicious shareholders trying to reconstruct the secret by obtaining legal shares from the other shareholders while providing them with fake shares. Verifiable Secret Sharing schemes solve this problem by allowing shareholders verifying the others' shares. We present new verification algorithms providing arbitrary secret sharing schemes with cheater detection capabilities, and prove their space efficiency with regard to other schemes appeared in the literature. We also introduce, in one of our schemes, the Exponentiating Polynomial Root Problem (EPRP), which is believed to be NP-Intermediate and therefore difficult.",

      "abstract":"Inter-cloud is an approach that facilitates scalable resource provisioning across multiple cloud infrastructures. In this paper, we focus on the performance optimization of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) using the meta-scheduling paradigm to achieve an improved job scheduling across multiple clouds. We propose a novel inter-cloud job scheduling framework and implement policies to optimize performance of participating clouds. The framework, named as Inter-Cloud Meta-Scheduling (ICMS), is based on a novel message exchange mechanism to allow optimization of job scheduling metrics. The resulting system offers improved flexibility, robustness and decentralization. We implemented a toolkit named “Simulating the Inter-Cloud” (SimIC) to perform the design and implementation of different inter-cloud entities and policies in the ICMS framework. An experimental analysis is produced for job executions in inter-cloud and a performance is presented for a number of parameters such as job execution, makespan, and turnaround times. The results highlight that the overall performance of individual clouds for selected parameters and configuration is improved when these are brought together under the proposed ICMS framework.",

      "abstract":"Outsourcing data to a third-party administrative control, as is done in cloud computing, gives rise to security concerns. The data compromise may occur due to attacks by other users and nodes within the cloud. Therefore, high security measures are required to protect data within the cloud. However, the employed security strategy must also take into account the optimization of the data retrieval time. In this paper, we propose division and replication of data in the cloud for optimal performance and security (DROPS) that collectively approaches the security and performance issues. In the DROPS methodology, we divide a file into fragments, and replicate the fragmented data over the cloud nodes. Each of the nodes stores only a single fragment of a particular data file that ensures that even in case of a successful attack, no meaningful information is revealed to the attacker. Moreover, the nodes storing the fragments, are separated with certain distance by means of graph T-coloring to prohibit an attacker of guessing the locations of the fragments. Furthermore, the DROPS methodology does not rely on the traditional cryptographic techniques for the data security; thereby relieving the system of computationally expensive methodologies. We show that the probability to locate and compromise all of the nodes storing the fragments of a single file is extremely low. We also compare the performance of the DROPS methodology with 10 other schemes. The higher level of security with slight performance overhead was observed.",

The fault detection consists of an innovations filter followed by a fault certification step, and requires no knowledge about the possible system faults. The innovations filter uses the optimal Boolean state estimator, called the Boolean Kalman Filter (BKF). In the presence of knowledge about the possible system faults, we propose an additional step of fault diagnosis based on a multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) method consisting of a bank of BKFs running in parallel. Performance is assessed by means of false detection and misdiagnosis rates, as well as average times until correct detection and diagnosis. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is demonstrated via numerical experiments using a p53-MDM2 negative feedback loop Boolean network with stuck-at faults that model molecular events commonly found in cancer.",

We present in this paper, MeTDiff, a novel computational tool for predicting differential m6A methylation sites from Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) data. Compared with the existing algorithm exomePeak, the advantages of MeTDiff are that it explicitly models the reads variation in data and also devices a more power likelihood ratio test for differential methylation site prediction. Comprehensive evaluation of MeTDiff's performance using both simulated and real datasets showed that MeTDiff is much more robust and achieved much higher sensitivity and specificity over exomePeak.",

      "abstract":"As a major strategy to ensure the safety of IT infrastructure, anomaly detection plays a more important role in cloud computing platform which hosts the entire applications and data. On top of the classic Markov chain model, we proposed in this paper a feasible multi-order Markov chain based framework for anomaly detection. In this approach, both the high-order Markov chain and multivariate time series are adopted to compose a scheme described in algorithms along with the training procedure in the form of statistical learning framework. To curb time and space complexity, the algorithms are designed and implemented with non-zero value table and logarithm values in initial and transition matrices. For validation, the series of system calls and the corresponding return values are extracted from classic Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) intrusion detection evaluation data set to form a two-dimensional test input set. The testing results show that the multi-order approach is able to produce more effective indicators: in addition to the absolute values given by an individual single-order model, the changes in ranking positions of outputs from different-order ones also correlate closely with abnormal behaviours.",

Computing efficiency of the grids is studied in several scenarios and new composite memristive structures are utilized in shortest path and maze-solving computations. The dependence of the computing medium behavior on the symmetry of both the underlying geometry and the employed devices, is validated through SPICE-level circuit simulations, which highlight important computing inefficiencies. Particular circuit-models of memristive connections enable precise mapping of the target application on the computing medium. Extraordinary functionalities emerge when novel memristive computing components, comprising different electrical characteristics from their structural elements, are introduced in the grid.

Based on the processing speed of MCC and the communication rate of 5G scheme, this system can monitor and locate patients in real time. Multiple base stations of the massive multiple input multiple output cooperate with each other to locate the patients using cross-location method. Then, a new direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm is proposed in the presence of unknown mutual coupling. The uncorrelated signals are first estimated using the estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique algorithm. Then, these estimators construct the manifold matrix of uncorrelated signals to estimate the mutual coupling coefficients. The information about uncorrelated signals and mutual coupling is eliminated based on oblique projection technique in order to estimate the DOAs of coherent signals using the original array. Finally, the DOAs of coherent signals are achieved based on sparse representation theory. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed algorithm.",

Because of the importance of privacy, many cloud storage encryption schemes have been proposed to protect data from those who do not have access. All such schemes assumed that cloud storage providers are safe and cannot be hacked; however, in practice, some authorities (i.e., coercers) may force cloud storage providers to reveal user secrets or confidential data on the cloud, thus altogether circumventing storage encryption schemes. In this paper, we present our design for a new cloud storage encryption scheme that enables cloud storage providers to create convincing fake user secrets to protect user privacy. Since coercers cannot tell if obtained secrets are true or not, the cloud storage providers ensure that user privacy is still securely protected.",

The circuit encodes these samples by the temporal difference between the onset times of two subsequent voltage jumps, which mimic action potentials of biological neurons. By combining elegantly concepts from renewal theory and analog very large scale integrated technology, the circuit is principally able to sample from arbitrary distributions of positive, real random variables. Moreover, these distributions can be defined online by the circuit-user in terms of an input current time-series, without the need to reconfigure the circuit. We show results from this circuit fabricated in a CMOS 0.35-μm technology process.

      "abstract":"Storage as a service has become an important paradigm in cloud computing for its great flexibility and economic savings. However, the development is hampered by data privacy concerns: data owners no longer physically possess the storage of their data. In this work, we study the issue of privacy-preserving set-valued data publishing. Existing data privacy-preserving techniques (such as encryption, suppression, generalization) are not applicable in many real scenes, since they would incur large overhead for data query or high information loss. Motivated by this observation, we present a suite of new techniques that make privacy-aware set-valued data publishing feasible on hybrid cloud. On data publishing phase, we propose a data partition technique, named extended quasi-identifierpartitioning (EQI-partitioning), which disassociates record terms that participate in identifying combinations. This way the cloud server cannot associate with high probability a record with rare term combinations. We prove the privacy guarantee of our mechanism. On data querying phase, we adopt interactive differential privacy strategy to resist privacy breaches from statistical queries. We finally evaluate its performance using real-life data sets on our cloud test-bed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the validity and practicality of the proposed scheme.",

      "abstract":"Wireless body area networks (WBANs) consist of many small low-power sensors, through which users could monitor the real-time parameters of patients' physiology remotely. This capability could improve medical care and the monitoring of patients. WBAN devices typically have limited computing, storage, power, and communication capabilities. These limitations restrict the applications that WBANs can support. To enhance the capabilities of WBANs, the concept of cloud-assisted WBANs has been introduced recently. By using cloud computing technologies, cloud-assisted WBANs can provide more efficient processing of patients' physiology parameters and support richer services. In cloud-assisted WBANs, the data of patients' physiology are stored in the cloud. The integrity of the data is very important because these data will be used to provide a medical diagnosis and other medical treatments. To address the issue of integrity in cloud-assisted WBANs, we propose an efficient certificateless public auditing (CLPA) scheme. A security analysis of our proposed CLPA scheme shows that it is provably secure against two types of adversaries (i.e., a type-I adversary can replace users' public keys, and a type-II adversary can access the master key) in an environment of certificateless cryptography. A detailed performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed CLPA scheme yields better performance over a previously proposed CLPA scheme.",

      "abstract":"In recent years cloud computing provides a new way to address the constraints of limited energy, capabilities, and resources. Distributed hash table (DHT) based distributed networks have become increasingly important for efficient communication in large-scale cloud systems. Previous studies mainly focus on improving the performance such as latency, scalability and robustness, but seldom consider the security demands on the routing paths, for example, bypassing untrusted intermediate nodes. Inspired by Internet source routing, in which the source nodes specify the routing paths taken by their packets, this paper presents CSR, a tag-based, Classified Source Routing scheme in distributed networks to satisfy the security demands on the routing paths. Different from Internet source routing which requires some map of the overall network, CSR operates in a distributed manner where nodes with certain security level are tagged with a label and routing messages requiring that level of security are forwarded only to the qualified next-hops. We show how this can be achieved efficiently, by simple extensions of the traditional routing structures, and safely, so that the routing is uniformly convergent. The effectiveness of our proposals is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and extensive simulations.",

In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of wild type and loss-of-virulence mutant F. verticillioides co-expression networks to identify subnetwork modules that are associated with its pathogenicity. We constructed the F. verticillioides co-expression networks from RNA-Seq data and searched through these networks to identify subnetwork modules that are differentially activated between the wild type and mutant F. verticillioides, which considerably differ in terms of pathogenic potentials. A greedy seed-and-extend approach was utilized in our search, where we also used an efficient branch-out technique for reliable prediction of functional subnetwork modules in the fungus. Through our analysis, we identified four potential pathogenicity-associated subnetwork modules, each of which consists of interacting genes with coordinated expression patterns, but whose activation level is significantly different in the wild type and the mutant. The predicted modules were comprised of functionally coherent genes and topologically cohesive. Furthermore, they contained several orthologs of known pathogenic genes in other fungi, which may play important roles in the fungal pathogenesis.",

This has led to the proliferation of business critical applications that leverage various cloud platforms. Such applications hosted on single/multiple cloud provider platforms have diverse characteristics requiring extensive monitoring and benchmarking mechanisms to ensure run-time Quality of Service (QoS) (e.g., latency and throughput). This paper proposes, develops and validates CLAMBS-Cross-Layer Multi-Cloud Application Monitoring and Benchmarking as-a-Service for efficient QoS monitoring and benchmarking of cloud applications hosted on multi-clouds environments. The major highlight of CLAMBS is its capability of monitoring and benchmarking individual application components such as databases and web servers, distributed across cloud layers (*-aaS), spread among multiple cloud providers. We validate CLAMBS using prototype implementation and extensive experimentation and show that CLAMBS efficiently monitors and benchmarks application components on multi-cloud platforms including Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure.",

      "abstract":"Ultra-high dimensional variable selection has become increasingly important in analysis of neuroimaging data. For example, in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) study, neuroscientists are interested in identifying important biomarkers for early detection of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using high resolution brain images that include hundreds of thousands voxels. However, most existing methods are not feasible for solving this problem due to their extensive computational costs. In this work, we propose a novel multiresolution variable selection procedure under a Bayesian probit regression framework. It recursively uses posterior samples for coarser-scale variable selection to guide the posterior inference on finer-scale variable selection, leading to very efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. The proposed algorithms are computationally feasible for ultra-high dimensional data. Also, our model incorporates two levels of structural information into variable selection using Ising priors: the spatial dependence between voxels and the functional connectivity between anatomical brain regions. Applied to the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data in the ABIDE study, our methods identify voxel-level imaging biomarkers highly predictive of the ASD, which are biologically meaningful and interpretable. Extensive simulations also show that our methods achieve better performance in variable selection compared to existing methods.",

There are currently a number of de novo transcriptome assembly methods, but it has been difficult to evaluate the quality of these assemblies. In order to assess the quality of the transcriptome assemblies, we composed a workflow of multiple quality check measurements that in combination provide a clear evaluation of the assembly performance. We presented novel transcriptome assemblies and functional annotations for Pacific Whiteleg Shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei), a mariculture species with great national and international interest, and no solid transcriptome/genome reference. We examined Pacific Whiteleg transcriptome assemblies via multiple metrics, and provide an improved gene annotation. Our investigations show that assessing the quality of an assembly purely based on the assembler's statistical measurements can be misleading; we propose a hybrid approach that consists of statistical quality checks and further biological-based evaluations.",

      "abstract":"Determining gender by examining the human brain is not a simple task because the spatial structure of the human brain is complex, and no obvious differences can be seen by the naked eyes. In this paper, we propose a novel three-dimensional feature descriptor, the three-dimensional weighted histogram of gradient orientation (3D WHGO) to describe this complex spatial structure. The descriptor combines local information for signal intensity and global three-dimensional spatial information for the whole brain. We also improve a framework to address the classification of three-dimensional images based on MRI. This framework, three-dimensional spatial pyramid, uses additional information regarding the spatial relationship between features. The proposed method can be used to distinguish gender at the individual level. We examine our method by using the gender identification of individual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of a large sample of healthy adults across four research sites, resulting in up to individual-level accuracies under the optimized parameters for distinguishing between females and males. Compared with previous methods, the proposed method obtains higher accuracy, which suggests that this technology has higher discriminative power. With its improved performance in gender identification, the proposed method may have the potential to inform clinical practice and aid in research on neurological and psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract":"One key requirement of a smart grid communication network (SGCN) is to provide wireless-enabled devices with a frequency spectrum for data transmission. This spectrum can be partially supplied from existing neighboring communication networks (NCNs) via spectrum ordering. The scope of this paper is to propose a coexistence scheme, in which NCNs declare their own price per frequency channel and allow an SGCN to make decisions on the number of channels to be ordered. Due to dynamic NCN conditions and, accordingly, time-varying channel pricing, the spectrum ordering by an SGCN over a time horizon is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem. Having decoupled the problem over time, a dynamic spectrum allocation scheme is proposed. As a result of this scheme, the required data transmission rate of an SGCN is provided statistically. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme from the viewpoint of the grid operational cost.",

      "abstract":"We propose an approach to protect confidentiality of data and accesses to them when data are stored and managed by external providers, and hence not under direct control of their owner. Our approach is based on the use of distributed data allocation among three independent servers and on a dynamic re-allocation of data at every access. Dynamic re-allocation is enforced by swapping data involved in an access across the servers in such a way that accessing a given node implies re-allocating it to a different server, then destroying the ability of servers to build knowledge by observing accesses. The use of three servers provides uncertainty, to the eyes of the servers, of the result of the swapping operation, even in presence of collusion among them.",

      "abstract":"With the exponential growth of data volume, big data have placed an unprecedented burden on current computing infrastructure. Dimensionality reduction of big data attracts a great deal of attention in recent years as an efficient method to extract the core data which is smaller to store and faster to process. This paper aims at addressing the three fundamental problems closely related to distributed dimensionality reduction of big data, i.e., big data fusion, dimensionality reduction algorithm and construction of distributed computing platform. A chunk tensor method is presented to fuse the unstructured, semi-structured and structured data as a unified model in which all characteristics of the heterogeneous data are appropriately arranged along the tensor orders. A Lanczos based high order singular value decomposition algorithm is proposed to reduce dimensionality of the unified model. Theoretical analyses of the algorithm are provided in terms of storage scheme, convergence property and computation cost. To execute the dimensionality reduction task, this paper employs the transparent computing paradigm to construct a distributed computing platform as well as utilizes a four-objectives optimization model to schedule the tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed holistic approach is efficient for distributed dimensionality reduction of big data.",

      "abstract":"Cloud computing, a distributed computing paradigm, enables delivery of IT resources over the Internet and follows the pay-as-you-go billing model. Workflow scheduling is one of the most challenging problems in cloud computing. Although, workflow scheduling on distributed systems like grids and clusters have been extensively studied, however, these solutions are not viable for a cloud environment. It is because, a cloud environment differs from other distributed environment in two major ways: on-demand resource provisioning and pay-as-you-go pricing model. Thus, to achieve the true benefits of workflow orchestration onto cloud resources novel approaches that can capitalize the advantages and address the challenges specific to a cloud environment needs to be developed. This work proposes a dynamic cost-effective deadline-constrained heuristic algorithm for scheduling a scientific workflow in a public cloud. The proposed technique aims to exploit the advantages offered by cloud computing while taking into account the virtual machine (VM) performance variability and instance acquisition delay to identify a just-in-time schedule of a deadline constrained scientific workflow at lesser costs. Performance evaluation on some well-known scientific workflows exhibit that the proposed algorithm delivers better performance in comparison to the current state-of-the-art heuristics.",

At present, some works explore this problem, but they often assume that only the nodes without messages probe the contacts. In this paper, we study the double probing problem. In particular, at time t, if a node has the message, it detects the contact with probability p(t). Otherwise, the probability is u(t). Then, this paper defines this problem as an optimization problem and solves it by Pontryagin's maximal principle. In addition, this paper proves that the both optimal policies conform to the threshold form. This result means that exploring the double probing policy is necessary.",

      "abstract":"Pathway analysis has been extensively applied to aid in the interpretation of the results of genome-wide transcription profiling studies, and has been shown to successfully find associations between the biological phenomena under study and biological pathways. There are two widely used approaches of pathway analysis: over-representation analysis, and gene set analysis. Recently genome-wide transcription factor binding data has become widely available allowing for the application of pathway analysis to this type of data. In this work, we developed regulatory enrichment pathway analysis (REPA) to apply gene set analysis to genome-wide transcription factor binding data to infer associations between transcription factors and biological pathways. We used the transcription factor binding data generated by the ENCODE project, and gene sets from the Molecular Signatures and KEGG databases. Our results showed that 54 percent of the predictions examined have literature support and that REPA's recall is roughly 54 percent. This level of precision is promising as several of REPA's predictions are expected to be novel and can be used to guide new research avenues. In addition, the results of our case studies showed that REPA enhances the interpretation of genome-wide transcription profiling studies by suggesting putative regulators behind the observed transcriptional responses.",

      "abstract":"For economic benefits and efficient management of resources, organizations are increasingly moving towards the paradigm of “cloud computing” by which they are allowed on-demand delivery of hardware, software and data as services. However, there are many security challenges which are particularly exacerbated by the multitenancy and virtualization features of cloud computing that allow sharing of resources among potentially untrusted tenants in access controlled cloud data centers. This can result in increased risk of data leakage. To address this risk vulnerability, we propose an efficient risk-aware virtual resource assignment mechanism for clouds multitenant environment. In particular, we introduce the notion of sensitivity in data centers and the objective is to minimize the risk of data leakage. In addition, the risk should not exceed in high sensitivity data centers in comparison to low sensitivity data centers. We present three assignment heuristics and compare their relative performance.",

      "abstract":"In order to improve simulation performance and to integrate simulation resources among geographically distributed locations, the concept of distributed simulation is proposed. Several types of distributed simulation standards, such as DIS and HLA, are established to formalize simulations and achieve reusability and interoperability of simulation components. To implement these distributed simulation standards and to manage the underlying system of distributed simulation applications, we employ grid computing and cloud computing technologies. These tackle the details of operation, configuration, and maintenance of simulation platforms in which simulation applications are deployed. However, for modelers who may not be familiar with the management of distributed systems, it is challenging to make a simulation-run-ready environment among different types of computing resources and network environments. In this article, a new multi-layered cloud-based scheme is proposed for enabling modeling and simulation based on different distributed simulation standards. This scheme is designed to ease the management of underlying resources and to achieve rapid elasticity that can provide unlimited computing capability to end users; it considers energy consumption, security, multi-user availability, scalability, and deployment issues. A mechanism for handling diverse network environments is described; by adopting it, idle public resources can be easily configured as additional computing capabilities for the local resource pool. A fast deployment model is built to relieve the migration and installation process of this platform. An energy-saving strategy is utilized to reduce the consumption of computing resources. Security components are implemented to protect sensitive information and block malicious attacks in the cloud. In the experiments, the proposed scheme is compared with its corresponding grid computing platform; the cloud computing platform achieves similar performance, but incorporates many advantages that the Cloud can provide.",

In such an environment, security issues are of primary concern as a potential resource misuse can severely impact user's privacy or even become life threatening. Access to these resources should be appropriately controlled to ensure that eHealth nodes are adequately protected and the services are available to authorized entities. The intrinsic resource limitations of these nodes, however, make satisfying these requirements a great challenge. This paper proposes and analyzes a service-oriented architecture that provides a policy-based, unified, cross-platform, and flexible access control mechanism, allowing authorized entities to consume services provided by eHealth nodes while protecting their valuable resources. The scheme is XACML driven, although modifications to the related standardized architecture are proposed to satisfy the requirements imposed by nodes that comprise low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). A proof-of-concept implementation is presented, along with the associated performance evaluation, confirming the feasibility of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract":"In mobile cloud networks (MCNs), a mobile user is connected with a cloud server through a network gateway, which is responsible for providing the required quality-of-service (QoS) to the users. If a user increases its service demand, the connecting gateway may fail to provide the requested QoS due to the overloaded demand, while the other gateways remain underloaded. Due to the increase in load in one gateway, the sharing of load among all the gateways is one of the prospective solutions for providing QoS-guaranteed services to the mobile users. Additionally, if a user misbehaves, the situation becomes more challenging. In this paper, we address the problem of QoS-guaranteed secured service provisioning in MCNs. We design a utility maximization problem for quality-assured secured load sharing (QuaLShare) in MCN, and determine its optimal solution using auction theory. In QuaLShare, the overloaded gateway detects the misbehaving gateways, and, then, prevents them from participating in the auction process. Theoretically, we characterize both the problem and the solution approaches in an MCN environment. Finally, we investigate the existence of Nash Equilibrium of the proposed scheme. We extend the solution for the case of multiple users, followed by theoretical analysis. Numerical analysis establishes the correctness of the proposed algorithms.",

      "abstract":"We describe a cloud-based medical image reconstruction service designed to meet a real-time and daily demand to reconstruct thousands of images from proton cancer treatment facilities worldwide. Rapid reconstruction of a three-dimensional Proton Computed Tomography (pCT) image can require the transfer of 100 GB of data and use of approximately 120 GPU-enabled compute nodes. The nature of proton therapy means that demand for such a service is sporadic and comes from potentially hundreds of clients worldwide. We thus explore the use of a commercial cloud as a scalable and cost-efficient platform for pCT reconstruction. To address the high performance requirements of this application we leverage Amazon Web Services' GPU-enabled cluster resources that are provisioned with high performance networks between nodes. To support episodic demand, we develop an on-demand multi-user provisioning service that can dynamically provision and resize clusters based on image reconstruction requirements, priorities, and wait times. We compare the performance of our pCT reconstruction service running on commercial cloud resources with that of the same application on dedicated local high performance computing resources. We show that we can achieve scalable and on-demand reconstruction of large scale pCT images for simultaneous multi-client requests, processing images in less than 10 minutes for less than $10 per image.",

As a result, it is predicted that intelligent devices and networks, including mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSN), will become the new interfaces to support future applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to minimize energy consumption of processing an application in MWSN while satisfying a certain completion time requirement. Specifically, by introducing the concept of cooperation, the logics and related computation tasks can be optimally partitioned, offloaded and executed with the help of peer sensor nodes, thus the proposed solution can be treated as a joint optimization of computing and networking resources. Moreover, for a network with multiple mobile wireless sensor nodes, we propose energy efficient cooperation node selection strategies to offer a tradeoff between fairness and energy consumption. Our performance analysis is supplemented by simulation results to show the significant energy saving of the proposed solution.",

In the latter, research leveraging online social networks (OSNs) must deal with a set of complex issues, such as ensuring data can be collected in an appropriate and reproducible manner. Making research reproducible is difficult, and researchers may need suitable incentives, and tools and systems, to do so. In this paper, we explore the state-of-the-art in OSN research reproducibility, and present an architecture to aid reproducibility. We characterize the reproducible OSN research using three main themes: 1) reporting of methods; 2) availability of code; and 3) sharing of research data. We survey 505 papers and assess the extent to which they achieve these reproducibility objectives. While systems-oriented papers are more likely to explain data-handling aspects of their methodology, social science papers are better at describing their participant-handling procedures. We then examine incentives to make research reproducible, by conducting a citation analysis of these papers. We find that sharing data are associated with increased citation count, while sharing method and code does not appear to be. Finally, we introduce our architecture which supports the conduct of reproducible OSN research, which we evaluate by replicating an existing research study.",

      "abstract":"Hadoop MapReduce is a leading open source framework that supports the realization of the Big Data revolution and serves as a pioneering platform in ultra large amount of information storing and processing. However, tuning a MapReduce system has become a difficult task because a large number of parameters restrict its performance, many of which are related with shuffle, a complicated phase between map and reduce functions, including sorting, grouping, and HTTP transferring. During shuffle phase, a large mount of time is spent on disk I/O due to the low speed of data throughput. In this paper, we build a mathematical model to judge the computing complexity of different operating orders within map-side shuffle, so that a faster execution can be achieved through reconfiguring the order of sorting and grouping. Furthermore, a three-dimensional exploring space of the performance is expanded, with which, some sampled features during shuffle stage, such as key number, spilling file number, and the variances of intermediate results, are collected to support the evaluation of computing complexity of each operating order. Thus, an optimized reconfiguration of map-side shuffle architecture can be achieved within Hadoop without extra disk I/O induced. Comparing with the original Hadoop implementation, the results show that our reconfigurable architecture gains up to 2.37χ speedup to finish the map-side shuffle work.",

      "abstract":"The surge of medical and e-commerce applications has generated tremendous amount of data, which brings people to a so-called “Big Data” era. Different from traditional large data sets, the term “Big Data” not only means the large size of data volume but also indicates the high velocity of data generation. However, current data mining and analytical techniques are facing the challenge of dealing with large volume data in a short period of time. This paper explores the efficiency of utilizing the Normal Distribution (ND) method for splitting and processing large volume medical data in cloud environment, which can provide representative information in the split data sets. The ND-based new model consists of two stages. The first stage adopts the ND method for large data sets splitting and processing, which can reduce the volume of data sets. The second stage implements the ND-based model in a cloud computing infrastructure for allocating the split data sets. The experimental results show substantial efficiency gains of the proposed method over the conventional methods without splitting data into small partitions. The ND-based method can generate representative data sets, which can offer efficient solution for large data processing. The split data sets can be processed in parallel in Cloud computing environment.",

      "abstract":"We consider a shadow routing based approach to the problem of real-time adaptive placement of virtual machines (VM) in large data centers (DC) within a network cloud. Such placement in particular has to respect vector packing constraints on the allocation of VMs to host physical machines (PM) within a DC, because each PM can potentially serve multiple VMs simultaneously. Shadow routing is attractive in that it allows a large variety of system objectives and/or constraints to be treated within a common framework (as long as the underlying optimization problem is convex). Perhaps even more attractive feature is that the corresponding algorithm is very simple to implement, it runs continuously, and adapts automatically to changes in the VM demand rates, changes in system parameters, etc., without the need to re-solve the underlying optimization problem “from scratch”. In this paper we focus on the min-max-DC-load problem. Namely, we propose a combined VM-to-DC routing and VM-to-PM assignment algorithm, referred to as Shadow scheme, which minimizes the maximum of appropriately defined DC utilizations. We prove that the Shadow scheme is asymptotically optimal (as one of its parameters goes to 0). Simulation confirms good performance and high adaptivity of the algorithm. Favorable performance is also demonstrated in comparison with a baseline algorithm based on VMware implementation [7], [8]. We also propose a simplified - “more distributed” - version of the Shadow scheme, which performs almost as well in simulations.",

With StarCube, each cloud service is allocated an isolated non-blocking virtual network topology, and the topology provisioned to each service is guaranteed logically unchanged during and after virtual machine reallocation. This resource management problem is formulated and proved to be NP-complete. To achieve high resource efficiency in acceptable time, we propose a cost-effective algorithm with polynomial-time complexity based on StarCube for on-demand resource allocation and reallocation. We demonstrate via extensive simulations that the server resources in StarCube-based cloud data centers can be nearly fully utilized with negligible reallocation cost. The results also show that StarCube supports a large variety of service provisioning feasibly and efficiently for cloud data centers of various scales and with dynamic demands. To the best of our knowledge, StarCube is the first solution to allocating and reallocating cloud services for fat-tree networks with guarantee on non-blocking properties.",

      "abstract":"Many big-data computing applications have been deployed in cloud platforms. These applications normally demand concurrent data transfers among computing nodes for parallel processing. It is important to find the best transfer scheduling leading to the least data retrieval time-the maximum throughput in other words. However, the existing methods cannot achieve this, because they ignore link bandwidths and the diversity of data replicas and paths. In this paper, we aim to develop a max-throughput data transfer scheduling to minimize the data retrieval time of applications. Specifically, the problem is formulated into mixed integer programming, and an approximation algorithm is proposed, with its approximation ratio analyzed. The extensive simulations demonstrate that our algorithm can obtain near optimal solutions.",

      "abstract":"With the emergence of big data computing and analysis, cloud computing services become more and more popular, which has recently drawn researchers' great attentions to develop various new applications and mechanisms. In this paper, we consider the on-demand mechanism design in the infrastructure as a service (IaaS), including resource allocation and pricing issues under dynamic scenarios. Most of existing works on mechanism design assumed static and independent individual utility, while the cloud computing services are provided in a dynamic environment. To solve such problems, we start with analyzing the Google cluster-usage dataset to draw the statistical and stochastic characteristics of the IaaS consumers and providers. Based on the characteristics mined from real data, we propose a stochastic matching algorithm with Markov Decision Process (MDP), which aims at optimizing the long-term system efficiency, with its online version using Q-learning method to address the imperfect model estimation problem. We further design an efficient (EF), incentive compatible (IC), individual rational (IR) auction mechanism, which is an extension of traditional Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism. The proposed mechanism is studied under two application scenario: quality sensitive services, where unilateral MDP-VCG auction is implemented; and quality insensitive services, where MDP-VCG double auction is implemented. To verify the performance of our proposed mechanism, we conduct experiment using the Google dataset and show that the proposed MDP-based VCG auction mechanism can achieve EF, IC and IR properties simultaneously.",

      "abstract":"Different from traditional web searching, the relevant information for a social network system (SNS) is commonly the content from his/her friends. Such a difference makes content indexing extremely difficult for an online social network (OSN) search system because every user has an individual view during searching. Building such a per-user view index over existing SNS Key-Value stores raises a large amount of communication cost due to the complex interconnections among OSN users, making the search system unscalable. To address the problem, we propose a novel protocol called summary index to support keyword searching. In the protocol, each user keeps a directory of the succinct summaries of his/her neighbors, and checks these summaries for potential hits before sending any queries. Two factors contribute to the low overhead of our design: the summary index representations are memory efficient, and the summary dissemination for index updating is communication efficient. First, we design an incremental scalable Bloom filter for summarizing the content constantly generated by a neighbor of a user. For an issued query by a user, the search system first checks against the summary index for a user's neighbor to predict the neighbors likely having desired content. Thus, the search system saves a significant inter-server communication cost by avoiding exhaustively transmitting the query to all the neighbors. Second, to further reduce the overhead for maintaining the social index, we leverage the piggyback strategy which exploits the links with high social strengths to avoid redundant messages during updating the per-user view summary index. We conduct comprehensive simulations using traces from real world systems to evaluate this design. Results show that our scheme significantly outperforms existing schemes for OSN searching in terms of inter-sever traffic by 98 percent.",

      "abstract":"Users expect isolated performance from rented virtual machines (VMs) in an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) cloud environment. However, this is not happening in todays’ systems because basically VMs are running in a shared environment. In this paper, we study performance degradation in a virtualized environment similar to IaaS clouds using Parsec 2.1 benchmarks. We consider slowdowns caused by hypervisor—hypervisor's noise—as well as co-located VMs—neighbors’ noise. Previous researches did not consider multi-virtual CPU (vCPU) VMs in an overcommitted environments similar to IaaS clouds. Our target system consists of multiple multi-processor VMs running on a commodity chip-multiprocessor by a hypervisor. This configuration is widespread in todays’ IaaS clouds like Amazon EC2. We find that performance degradation in a virtualized environment could be up to  $16\\times$  which is far more than previous findings. Beside shared resources of memory sub-system, blindness of hypervisor's scheduler have large impact on the slowdown and this is contrary to recent researches that mostly blame last-level cache (LLC) contention for performance degradation. After investigating the causes of performance degradation, we provide some ideas that motivate researchers to reduce performance degradation through hardware and software techniques. We also mention some hints that help organizations to see if their applications are ready for the cloud.",

      "abstract":"Due to interference from other coexisting wireless body area networks (WBANs), link quality between a particular WBAN and access points (APs) significantly varies. Consequently, the performance of a WBAN varies with the changes in the link quality. Additionally, a WBAN unnecessarily tries to send its real-time data to the sink node, whereas the corresponding link quality drops below a predefined threshold value, to maintain adequate network performance. To address this situation, in this paper, we propose a link-quality-aware resource allocation scheme in WBANs-an effort toward maximizing the overall network performance. The proposed scheme consists of two phases-temporal link quality measurement and subchannel allocation among the WBANs. In the former, we predict correlations among different aspects of link quality. Based on the available correlated link qualities, the subchannel allocation phase divides the available bandwidth into several subchannels to maintain the quality of service of the network. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated based on different performance metrics-path loss, throughput, number of dead nodes, and fairness index of WBANs. The simulation results show that the performance of a WBAN significantly increases, if the link-quality-aware resource allocation is made between a WBAN and available APs.",

      "abstract":"Nowadays, service oriented architecture (SOA) has become one mainstream paradigm for developing distributed applications. As the basic unit in SOA, web services can be composed to construct complex applications. The quality of web services and their compositions is critical to the success of SOA applications. Testing, as a major quality assurance technique, is confronted with new challenges in the context of service compositions. In this paper, we propose a scenario-oriented testing approach that can automatically generate test cases for service compositions. Our approach is particularly focused on the service compositions specified by Business Process Execution Language for web services (WS-BPEL), a widely recognized executable service composition language. In the approach, a WS-BPEL service composition is first abstracted into a graph model; test scenarios are then derived from the model; finally, test cases are generated according to different scenarios. We also developed a prototype tool implementing the proposed approach, and an empirical study was conducted to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach. The experimental results show that the automatic scenario-oriented testing approach is effective in detecting many types of faults seeded in the service compositions.",

      "abstract":"The cloud paradigm has become increasingly attractive throughout the recent years due to its both technical and economic foreseen impact. Therefore, researchers' and practitioners' attention has been drawn to enhancing the technological characteristics of cloud services, such as performance, scalability or security. However, the topic of identifying and understanding cloud consumers' real needs has largely been ignored. Existing requirements elicitation methods are not appropriate for the cloud computing domain, where consumers are highly heterogeneous and geographically distributed, have frequent change requests and expect services to be delivered at a fast pace. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to requirements elicitation for cloud services, which utilizes consumers' advanced search queries for services to infer requirements that can lead to new cloud solutions. For this, starting from the queries, we build fuzzy Galois lattices that can be used by public cloud providers to analyze market needs and trends, as well as optimum solutions for satisfying the largest populations possible with a minimum set of features implemented. This new approach complements the existing requirements elicitation techniques in that it is a dedicated cloud method which operates with data that already exists, without entailing the active participation of consumers and requirements specialists.",

      "abstract":"Current QoS-aware automatic service composition queries over a network of web services are often one-time in nature. After a network of web services is built, such queries are issued once, and answers are found from the scratch. The underlying assumption is that the participating web services are rather static, which means that their functional and non-functional parameters seldom change. However, such an assumption is often baseless. New services come and go, service APIs change gradually, and QoS values fluctuate in practice. Therefore, a support for efficiently adapting service composition is desired. In this paper, we propose an event driven continuous query algorithm to intelligently cope with different types of dynamic services, and thus enable evolution of service composition. Evaluation using both real QoS data and synthetic web service data shows its superior performance, compared with the state-of-the-art solution which won the performance championship of Web Service Challenge in 2009 and 2010. Moreover, we generalize a new graph problem: dynamic single-source optimal-Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) problem based on the above work. It is argued that API recommendation for framework evolution, as another typical application, could also be modeled and addressed efficiently using the proposed new graph approach.",

      "abstract":"With the increasing volume of data to be analysed, one of the challenges in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is to make web services efficient in processing large-scale data. Parallel execution and cloud technologies are the keys to speed-up the service invocation. In SOA, service providers typically employ policies to limit parallel execution of the services based on arbitrary decisions. In order to attain optimal performance improvement, users need to adapt to the services policies. A composite service is a combination of several atomic services provided by various providers. To use parallel execution for greater composite service efficiency, the degree of parallelism (DOP) of the composite services need to be optimized by considering the policies of all atomic services. We propose a model that embeds service policies into formulae to calculate composite service performance. From the calculation, we predict the optimal DOP for the composite service, where it attains the best performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world translation services. We use several measures such as mean prediction error (MPE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and tracking signal (TS) to evaluate our model. The analysis results show that our proposed model has good prediction accuracy in identifying optimal DOPs for composite services.",

      "abstract":"Infrastructure planners need new methods to exchange technical data in the pursuit of long-term and cross-sector objectives including sustainability. This paper demonstrates a method for infrastructure system simulation interoperability by applying the high-level architecture (HLA) to the infrastructure system of systems (ISoS) modeling framework. The ISoS considers time-aggregated simulations with iterative data exchange periods to resolve cyclic dependencies. Applying the HLA defines object models, operational agreements, federate implementations, and physical infrastructure required for a federated simulation. An example demonstrates the method on a scenario with 18 infrastructure elements across water, electricity, petroleum, and social sectors as individual federates. The cost of interoperability arises from network latency, runtime infrastructure (RTI) overhead, and additional development effort. Results across several RTIs show that a distributed simulation requires 10-100 times longer executions than noninteroperable configurations. Analysis of source code shows that the HLA contributes about 1500 (56%) more software lines of code to implement federation object models and agreements. The value of interoperability arises from new capabilities provided by the HLA: physical distribution and independent control of constituent models. Conclusions describe a role for the HLA in model-based concept exploration during collaborative and interorganizational design activities with live human participation similar to its use for wargames.",

      "abstract":"Many cloud applications (e.g., data backup and replication, video distribution) require dissemination of large volumes of data from a source data-center to multiple geographically distributed data-centers. Given the high costs of wide-area bandwidth, the overall cost of inter-data-center communication is a major concern in such scenarios. While previous works have focused on optimizing the costs of bulk transfer, most of them use the charging models of Internet service providers, typically based on the 95th percentile of bandwidth consumption. However, public Cloud Service Providers (CSP) follow very different models to charge their customers. First, the cost for transmission is flat and depends on the location of the source and receiver data-centers. Second, CSPs offer discounts once customer transfers exceed certain volume thresholds per data-center. We present a systematic framework, CloudMPcast, that exploits these two aspects of cloud pricing schemes. CloudMPcast constructs overlay distribution trees for bulk-data transfer that both optimizes dollar costs of distribution, and ensures end-to-end data transfer times are not affected. CloudMPCast monitors TCP throughputs between data-centers and only proposes alternative trees that respect original transfer times. After an extensive measurement study, the cost savings range from 10 to 60 percent for both Azure and EC2 infrastructures, which potentially translates to millions of dollars a year assuming realistic demands.",

The task scheduler model focused on energy optimization was proposed for the centralized task scheduling problem. In this paper, the model extends the optimization process by including an economic element to it. Thus, we propose an energy and monetary cost-aware mathematical task scheduler model. Compared to the previous model, this model, can allow mobile devices to offload multiple tasks to cloud resources. The results in this paper are more thorough and more aspects of task offloading have been analysed. For instance, the model is evaluated under two different resource augmentation environments for mobile cloud computing: a local private cloud and public clouds. More precisely, the task scheduling problem is optimally solved to minimize: (i) the total energy consumption when applied to a local private cloud, and (ii) the total energy consumption and monetary cost when applied to public clouds. Our proposed model at the centralized broker-node finds optimal solutions for task assignment problem, and provides a significant reduction in the total costs compared with the task assignment by the centralized scheduler without optimization.",

In most cases, data providers have no/little control that has led to concern that the personal data may be beached. Microaggregation techniques seek to protect microdata in such a way that data can be published and mined without providing any private information that can be linked to specific individuals. An optimal microaggregation method must minimize the information loss resulting from this replacement process. The challenge is how to minimize the information loss during the microaggregation process. This paper presents a sorting framework for Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) to protect microdata in cloud computing. It consists of two stages. In the first stage, an algorithm sorts all records in a data set in a particular way to ensure that during microaggregation very dissimilar observations are never entered into the same cluster. In the second stage a microaggregation method is used to create k-anonymous clusters while minimizing the information loss. The performance of the proposed techniques is compared against the most recent microaggregation methods. Experimental results using benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithms perform significantly better than existing associate techniques in the literature.",

Insufficient available bandwidth in inter-cloud links can increase the makespan and the monetary cost to execute the application on public clouds. Imprecise information about the available bandwidth can lead to inefficient scheduling decisions. This paper attempts to evaluate the impact of imprecise information about the available bandwidth in inter-cloud links on workflow schedules, and it proposes a mechanism to cope with imprecise information about the available bandwidth and its impact on the makespan and cost estimates. The proposed mechanism applies a deflating factor on the available bandwidth value furnished as input to the scheduler. Simulation results showed that the mechanism is able to increase the number of solutions with makespans that are shorter than the defined deadline and reduce the underestimations of the makespan and cost provided by workflow schedulers.",

However, in many cases cloud technology is still proprietary and tainted by security issues rooted in the multi-user and hybrid cloud environment. A lack of secure connectivity in a hybrid cloud environment hinders the adaptation of clouds by scientific communities that require scaling-out of the local infrastructure using publicly available resources for large-scale experiments. In this article, we present a case study of the DII-HEP secure cloud infrastructure and propose an approach to securely scale-out a private cloud deployment to public clouds in order to support hybrid cloud scenarios. A challenge in such scenarios is that cloud vendors may offer varying and possibly incompatible ways to isolate and interconnect virtual machines located in different cloud networks. Our approach is tenant driven in the sense that the tenant provides its connectivity mechanism. We provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of a number of alternatives to solve this problem.

Growing literature supports that cognitive deficits may also be present in PD, even in non-demented patients. Gray matter (GM) atrophy has been reported in PD and may be related to cognitive decline. This study investigated cortical thickness in non-demented PD subjects and elucidated its relationship to cognitive impairment using high-resolution T1-weighted brain MRI and comprehensive cognitive function scores from 71 non-demented PD and 48 control subjects matched for age, gender, and education. Cortical thickness was compared between groups using a flexible hierarchical multivariate Bayesian model, which accounts for correlations between brain regions. Correlation analyses were performed among brain areas and cognitive domains as well, which showed significant group differences in the PD population. Compared to Controls, PD subjects demonstrated significant age-adjusted cortical thinning predominantly in inferior and superior parietal areas and extended to superior frontal, superior temporal, and precuneus areas (posterior probability >0.9). Cortical thinning was also found in the left precentral and lateral occipital, and right postcentral, middle frontal, and fusiform regions (posterior probability >0.9). PD patients showed significantly reduced cognitive performance in executive function, including set shifting (p = 0.005) and spontaneous flexibility (p = 0.02), which were associated with the above cortical thinning regions (p <; 0.05).",

      "abstract":"Owing to its high spectral efficiency (SE), two-way relaying (TWR) has aroused tremendous research interests. Recently, substantial progress in self-interference (SI) cancelation makes full-duplex (FD) TWR practical. For this new paradigm, analyzing spectral-energy efficiency (SE-EE) tradeoff is crucial, which has not been addressed in the existing works in the literature. In this paper, the SE-EE tradeoff in a FDTW relay network with amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying is studied by considering the residual SI at the relay. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the EE under the SE requirement and the maximum transmission power constraints by adjusting the transmission power of the terminals and the amplification gain of the relay. A lower complexity iterative optimization algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results show that: 1) the proposed algorithm can achieve optimal EE that is consistent to the one obtained by the exclusive searching method; 2) the FDTW relay network can achieve higher SE but lower optimal EE compared with the half-duplex (HD) one; and 3) the optimal EE is insensitive to the residual power of SI, when the relay is located near either terminal.",

Specifically, we investigate energy-efficient dispatching policy for VSaaS under N-version protection, which dispatches a file to multiple service engines for scanning in parallel to reduce the missed detection error cost. However, the benefit of N-version protection is at the cost of increasing energy consumption and the queue length of service engines. To manage this tradeoff, we aim to reduce the energy consumption of service engines and the missed detection error cost, while satisfying the queue stability for VSaaS. We formulate the file-scan dispatching policy as a stochastic optimization problem, and then propose an online algorithm to dispatch file-scan requests under N-version protection. We show that we can achieve the penalty function, i.e., the combination of the energy consumption and the missed detection error cost, arbitrarily close to the minimum but at the cost of increasing the queue length. Moreover, we compare the proposed dispatching algorithm with the K-least delay algorithm and show by simulation that the proposed dispatching algorithm is more energy efficient to provide N-version protection for VSaaS.",

We present a cloud-based virtual learning environment (VLE) which can organize learners into a better teamwork context and customize micro learning resources in order to meet personal demands in real time. Particularly, a smart micro learning environment was built by a newly designed Software as a Service (SaaS), namely Micro Learning as a Service (MLaaS). It aims to provide adaptive micro learning contents as well as learning path identifications customized for each individual learner. To personalize the micro learning, a dynamic learner model is constructed with regards to the internal and external factors that can affect learning experience and outcomes. Educational data mining (EDM) techniques are employed as the main method to understand learners' behaviors and recognize learning resource features. A solution of learning path optimization is also proposed towards assembling a complete MOOC learning experience.",

      "abstract":"Collaborative development communities and knowledge sharing communities are highly correlated and mutually complementary. The knowledge sharing between these two types of open source communities can be very beneficial to both of them. However, it is a great challenge to automate this process. Current studies mainly focus on knowledge acquisition in one type of community, and few of them have tackle this problem efficiently. In this paper we take Android Issue Tracker and Stack Overflow as a case to study the mutual knowledge sharing between them. We propose an automatic approach by integrating semantic similarity with temporal locality between Android issues and Stack Overflow posts based on the internal citation-graph to reveal the potential associations between them. Our approach explores the internal citations in communities for closely related posts or issues clustering, exploits the rich semantics in fine-grained information of issues and posts for associations building, and leverages the temporal correlations between issues and posts in-depth for associations ranking. Extensive experiments show that the precision of our approach reaches 62.51 percent for top 10 recommendations when recommending Stack Overflow posts to Android issues, and 66.83 percent in reverse.",

      "abstract":"Genome Rearrangements are large-scale mutational events that affect genomes during the evolutionary process. Therefore, these mutations differ from punctual mutations. They can move genes from one place to the other, change the orientation of some genes, or even change the number of chromosomes. In this work, we deal with inversion events which occur when a segment of DNA sequence in the genome is reversed. In our model, each inversion costs the number of elements in the reversed segment. We present a new algorithm for this problem based on the metaheuristic called Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) that has been routinely used to find solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. In essence, we implemented an iterative process in which each iteration receives a feasible solution whose neighborhood is investigated. Our analysis shows that we outperform any other approach by significant margin. We also use our algorithm to build phylogenetic trees for a subset of species in the Yersinia genus and we compared our trees to other results in the literature.",

Motivated by the significance of tail sojourn times for cloud clusters, we develop a model of N parallel virtual server queues, each of which processes jobs in a processor sharing fashion under varying execution speeds governed by Markov-modulated processes. We derive the tail distribution of the workloads for each server and the approximation for the tail sojourn times based on large deviation analysis. Furthermore, we optimize the cluster sizes that fulfill the requirements of target tail sojourn times. Extensive simulation experiments show very good matches to the derived analysis in a variety of scenarios, i.e., large numbers of servers experiencing a high number of different execution speeds, under various traffic intensities, workload variations and cluster sizes. Finally, we apply our proposed analysis to estimating the tail sojourn times of a Wikipedia system hosted in a private cloud, and the testbed results strongly confirm the applicability and accuracy of our analysis.",

      "abstract":"MapReduce is a software framework for processing data-intensive applications with a parallel manner in cloud computing systems. Some MapReduce jobs have the deadline requirements for their job execution. The existing deadline-constrained MapReduce scheduling schemes do not consider the following two problems: various node performance and dynamical task execution time. In this paper, we utilize the Bipartite Graph modelling to propose a new MapReduce Scheduler called the BGMRS. The BGMRS can obtain the optimal solution of the deadline-constrained scheduling problem by transforming the problem into a well-known graph problem: minimum weighted bipartite matching. The BGMRS has the following features. It considers the heterogeneous cloud computing environment, such that the computing resources of some nodes cannot meet the deadlines of some jobs. In addition to meeting the deadline requirement, the BGMRS also takes the data locality into the computing resource allocation for shortening the data access time of a job. However, if the total available computing resources of the system cannot satisfy the deadline requirements of all jobs, the BGMRS can minimize the number of jobs with the deadline violation. Finally, both simulation and testbed experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the BGMRS in the deadline-constrained scheduling.",

      "abstract":"MapReduce plays a critical role as a leading framework for big data analytics. In this paper, we consider a geo-distributed cloud architecture that provides MapReduce services based on the big data collected from end users all over the world. Existing work handles MapReduce jobs by a traditional computation-centric approach that all input data distributed in multiple clouds are aggregated to a virtual cluster that resides in a single cloud. Its poor efficiency and high cost for big data support motivate us to propose a novel data-centric architecture with three key techniques, namely, cross-cloud virtual cluster, data-centric job placement, and network coding based traffic routing. Our design leads to an optimization framework with the objective of minimizing both computation and transmission cost for running a set of MapReduce jobs in geo-distributed clouds. We further design a parallel algorithm by decomposing the original large-scale problem into several distributively solvable subproblems that are coordinated by a high-level master problem. Finally, we conduct real-world experiments and extensive simulations to show that our proposal significantly outperforms the existing works.",

Thus, meeting the QoS requirements of so many diverse applications in such shared resource environments has become a real challenge, especially since the characteristics and workload of applications differ widely and may change over time. This paper presents an experimental system that can exploit a variety of online QoS aware adaptive task allocation schemes, and three such schemes are designed and compared. These are a measurement driven algorithm that uses reinforcement learning, secondly a “sensible” allocation algorithm that assigns tasks to sub-systems that are observed to provide a lower response time, and then an algorithm that splits the task arrival stream into sub-streams at rates computed from the hosts' processing capabilities. All of these schemes are compared via measurements among themselves and with a simple round-robin scheduler, on two experimental test-beds with homogenous and heterogenous hosts having different processing capacities.",

      "abstract":"There are a variety of well-designed specification-modelling-languages serving Internet services, however, none of them is capable of describing the special features of cloud services, from both technical and business points of view. The Unified Service Description Language (USDL) provides a new way to describe Internet services from business, operational, and technical perspectives. Nevertheless, there are various issues with USDL: it lacks a comprehensive specification model, particularly for cloud services, lacks a user-centric specification modeling paradigm, lacks a mechanism to measure cloud service attributes and to present the association relationship and re-usability of the attributes, and lacks semantic representation of cloud services. Based on the above issues, we propose a unified semantic Cloud Service Description Model (CSDM) in this paper. The proposed model will be extended from the basic structure of USDL, by defining cloud-service-specific attributes. Furthermore, an additional module, named transaction module, will be defined, which models the rating system of cloud services from several aspects, such as risk, trust, and reputation. The transaction module facilitates the capability of CSDM with regard to service ranking, and enhances its flexibility and extensibility by providing an extensible sub-module. In addition, we design an OWL-based annotation system to enrich the semantic expressivity of this model. Finally, a case study is provided to explain the application of this model in actual cloud services.",

This paper focuses on the trust computing requirement of multi-cloud collaborative services and develops a Data-driven and Feedback-Enhanced Trust (DFET) computing pattern across multiple data centers with several innovative mechanisms. First, a trust-aware service monitoring architecture is proposed based on distributed soft agents to serve as middleware for multi-cloud trust computing and task scheduling. A data-driven trust computation scheme based on multi-indicator monitoring data is then proposed. The integration of several key service indicators into trust computing makes this scheme suitable for service-oriented cloud applications. More importantly, according to the intrinsic relationship among users, monitors, and service providers, we propose an enhanced and hierarchical feedback mechanism that can effectively reduce networking risk while improving system dependability. Theoretical analysis shows that DFET pattern is highly dependable against garnished and bad-mouthing attacks. We also build a prototype system to verify the feasibility of DFET pattern and the experiments yield meaningful observations that can facilitate the effective utilization of DFET in the large-scale multi-cloud collaborative environment.",

      "abstract":"Recent studies have suggested abnormal brain network organization in subjects with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Here we applied spectral clustering algorithm, diverse centrality measures (betweenness (BC), clustering (CC), eigenvector (EC), and degree (DC)), and also the network entropy (NE) to identify brain sub-systems associated with ASD. We have found that BC increases in the following ASD clusters: in the somatomotor, default-mode, cerebellar, and fronto-parietal. On the other hand, CC, EC, and DC decrease in the somatomotor, default-mode, and cerebellar clusters. Additionally, NE decreases in ASD in the cerebellar cluster. These findings reinforce the hypothesis of under-connectivity in ASD and suggest that the difference in the network organization is more prominent in the cerebellar system. The cerebellar cluster presents reduced NE in ASD, which relates to a more regular organization of the networks. These results might be important to improve current understanding about the etiological processes and the development of potential tools supporting diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.",

      "abstract":"The energy demands of Ethernet links have been an active focus of research in the recent years. This work has enabled a new generation of energy-efficient Ethernet (EEE) interfaces able to adapt their power consumption to the actual traffic demands, thus yielding significant energy savings. With the energy consumption of single network connections being a solved problem, in this paper, we focus on the energy demands of link aggregates that are commonly used to increase the capacity of a network connection. We build on known energy models of single EEE links to derive the energy demands of the whole aggregate as a function on how the traffic load is spread among its powered links. We then provide a practical method to share the load that minimizes overall energy consumption with controlled packet delay and prove that it is valid for a wide range of EEE links. Finally, we validate our method with both synthetic and real traffic traces captured in Internet backbones.",

In this paper, the coverage probabilities for both the macrotier and microtier networks are derived, followed by maximizing the coverage probability of the HetNets conceived for optimizing both the PSR factor and macro-microbase station's (BS) active probability ratio (APR). Furthermore, the problem of energy consumption minimization in HetNets can be addressed by analyzing the relationship between the optimal PSR factor and APR. Numerical results show that, under both the closed-access strategy and interference-limited case, and additionally by setting the signal to interference and noise ratio target to be 20 dB, the energy consumption of up to 50% in a two-tier HetNet can be saved by invoking the proposed joint optimization method, without eroding the average ergodic rate, provided that the macrocell BS (macroBS) transmit power is as high as five times that of the microcell BSs (microBSs).",

Most of existing studies on the virtual machine migration, however are based on a single virtual machine migration. Although there are some researches on multiple virtual machines migration, the author usually does not consider the correlation among these virtual machines. In practice, in order to save energy and maintain system performance, cloud providers usually need to migrate multiple correlated virtual machines or migrate the entire virtual datacenter (VDC) request. In this paper, we focus on the efficient online live migration of multiple correlated VMs in VDC requests, for optimizing the migration performance. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient VDC migration algorithm (VDC-M). We use the US-wide US National Science Foundation (NSF) network as substrate network to conduct extensive simulation experiments. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is promising in terms of the total VDC remapping cost, the blocking ratio, the average migration time and the average downtime.",

These mechanisms are widely used in distributed computer networks. This investigation proposes an efficient and secure single-sign-on authentication scheme that uses extended chaotic maps, exhibits operations that satisfy the semigroup property and commutative under composition, and has a higher efficiency than modular exponential computations and scalar multiplications on the elliptic curve. The session key security of the proposed scheme is based on Chebyshev chaotic-map-based assumptions, and the scheme is proven to be secure using the real-or-random model. The proposed authentication scheme retains the security properties of earlier schemes, requires fewer transmissions, has a lower computational cost, and uses fewer variables; it is therefore efficient in computation and communication.",

      "abstract":"Graph edit distance is one of the most flexible and general graph matching models available. The major drawback of graph edit distance, however, is its computational complexity that restricts its applicability to graphs of rather small size. Recently, the authors of the present paper introduced a general approximation framework for the graph edit distance problem. The basic idea of this specific algorithm is to first compute an optimal assignment of independent local graph structures (including substitutions, deletions, and insertions of nodes and edges). This optimal assignment is complete and consistent with respect to the involved nodes of both graphs and can thus be used to instantly derive an admissible (yet suboptimal) solution for the original graph edit distance problem in $O(n^3)$O(n3) time. For large scale graphs or graph sets, however, the cubic time complexity may still be too high. Therefore, we propose to use suboptimal algorithms with quadratic rather than cubic time for solving the basic assignment problem. In particular, the present paper introduces five different greedy assignment algorithms in the context of graph edit distance approximation. In an experimental evaluation, we show that these methods have great potential for further speeding up the computation of graph edit distance while the approximated distances remain sufficiently accurate for graph based pattern classification.",

      "abstract":"To facilitate mobile cloud computing, a cloud service provider must dynamically create and terminate a large number of virtual machines (VMs), causing fragmented resources that cannot be further utilized. To solve this problem proactively, most of the existing studies have been based on server consolidation, with the main objective of minimizing the number of active servers. Although this approach can minimize resource fragmentation at a particular time, it may be over aggressive at the price of too frequent VM migration and low system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel provident resource defragmentation framework that is revenue-oriented with the goal to reduce unnecessary VM migration. Within the proposed framework, we formulate an optimization problem for resource defragmentation at a particular time epoch, with the consideration of the future impact of any VM migration. We then develop an efficient heuristic algorithm that can obtain near-optimal results. Extensive numerical results confirm that our framework can provide the highest profit and can significantly reduce the VM migration cost in practical scenarios.",

      "abstract":"Service Oriented Computing (SOC) has initially developed for the Internet, but also identified as an appealing computing paradigm for developing applications in distributed wireless environments. The open nature of wireless medium may expose services to a variety of unauthorized third parties (eavesdroppers), resulting in insecure service interactions, while cooperative jamming is promising to provide a strong form of security. This paper focuses on security performance study of wireless communications for service interactions among different parties in SOC. More specifically, this paper establishes a theoretical framework for the study of eavesdropper-tolerance capability (i.e., the maximum number of eavesdroppers that can be tolerated) in a two-hop wireless network, where the cooperative jamming is adopted to ensure security defined by secrecy outage probability (SOP) and opportunistic relaying is adopted to guarantee reliability defined by transmission outage probability (TOP). For the concerned network, exact modeling for SOP and fine approximation for TOP are first conducted based on the Central Limit Theorem. With the help of SOP and TOP models and also the Stochastic Ordering Theory, the model for eavesdropper-tolerance capability analysis is then developed. Finally, extensive simulation and numerical results are provided to illustrate the efficiency of our theoretical framework as well as the eavesdropper-tolerance capability of the concerned network from adopting cooperative jamming and opportunistic relaying.",

Geo-distributed mobile cloud computing (GMCC) is a new scenario that adds geography consideration in mobile cloud computing. In GMCC, users are able to access cloud resources that are geographically close to their mobile devices. This is expected to reduce the communication delay and the service providers cost compared with the traditional centralized approach. In this paper, we focus on resource sharing through the cooperation among the service providers in geo-distributed mobile cloud computing. Then, we propose two different strategies for efficient resource cooperation in geographically distributed data centers. Furthermore, we present a coalition game theoretical approach to deal with the competition and the cooperation among the service providers. Utility functions have been specifically considered to incorporate the cost related to virtual machine migration and resource utilization. Illustrative results indicate that our proposed schemes are able to efficiently utilize limited resources with quality-of-service consideration.",

Overall, we detected 4 percent of all exon-skipping events found in RNA-seq data, regardless of their effect on reading frame. The fraction of alternative isoforms detected did not differ between out-of-frame and in-frame events. Moreover, the fraction of identified alternative exon-exon junctions and constitutive junctions were similar. Together, our results suggest that both in-frame and out-of-frame translation may be actively used to regulate protein activity or localization.",

We propose a novel approach for integrating various types of ontologies efficiently and apply it to integrate International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9CM), and Gene Ontologies. This approach is one of the early attempts to quantify the associations among clinical terms (e.g., ICD9 codes) based on their corresponding genomic relationships. We reconstructed a merged tree for a partial set of GO and ICD9 codes and measured the performance of this tree in terms of associations' relevance by comparing them with two well-known disease-gene datasets (i.e., MalaCards and Disease Ontology). Furthermore, we compared the genomic-based ICD9 associations to temporal relationships between them from electronic health records. Our analysis shows promising associations supported by both comparisons suggesting a high reliability. We also manually analyzed several significant associations and found promising support from literature.",

      "abstract":"As the number of Cloud services is growing at a tremendous speed, there is an increasing number of service providers offering similar functionalities. Selecting services with user desired non-functional properties (NFPs) becomes of significant importance but triggers a number of Big Data related research issues. First, the selection decision should deal with a large volume of service NFPs data. Second, service selection needs to reflect diverse user preferences, including both qualitative and quantitative ones. Third, the uncertainty of the network and service load leads to high variability in NFPs. Fourth, as the trust values of service NFPs are collected via historic user's feedbacks,it brings the veracity dimension to the NFPs of services. Fifth, multiple and sometimes conflicting decision objectives for optimal service selection should be balanced. An effective service selection mechanism is in demand that can tackle all the above Big Data challenges in an integrated way to handle the highly diverse QoS with significant variability along with the trust related issues giving rise to data veracity. Existing investigations focus on either users' QoS preferences or their trust concerns but fail to provide a systematic solution to integrate both criteria in the selection process. In this paper, we tackle heterogeneous preference- and trust-based service selection by developing a novel multi-objective optimization approach to make trade-off decision between service's trust value and user's QoS preference to rank candidate Cloud services based on their match degrees with users' requirements. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract":"One of the major challenges for safeguarding the security of big data in the cloud is how to detect and prevent malicious software (malware). Despite of the fact that security and privacy are critical issues in big data, more research needs to be done in this area. As malware can affect the reliability of the data and subsequently the reputation of the system, it is critical to detect and remove malware from a system as early as possible. Recently, ensembles that combine a set of classifiers have been proposed as an efficient approach for malware detection. Unfortunately, the size, meHA85-C0002-A008mory and processing requirements as well as the high cost of data transfer during training and operation make large ensemble classifiers unsuitable for big data in the cloud. To address this problem, we propose a new advanced ensemble pruning method, Hybrid Consensus Pruning (HCP), which is the first pruning algorithm that employs a fast consensus function to combine several classifier classes into one scheme. To test the effectiveness of the HCP method, we conducted experiments comparing its performance with Ensemble Pruning via Individual Contribution ordering (EPIC), Directed Hill Climbing Ensemble Pruning (DHCEP) and K-Means Pruning approaches for pruning very large ensemble classifiers for malware detection. The results of the experiments show that HCP achieved better results by producing better ensemble classifiers as compared to those created by EPIC, DHCEP and K-Means Pruning.",

      "abstract":"Cloud provides large shared resources where users (or foundations) can enjoy the facility of storing data or executing applications. In spite of gaining convenience of large resources, storing critical data in cloud is not secured. Hence, cloud security is an important issue to make cloud useful at the enterprise level. Data encryption is a primary solution for providing confidentiality to sensitive data. However, processing of encrypted data requires extra overhead, since repeated encryption-decryption need to be performed for every simple processing on encrypted data. Hence, direct processing on encrypted cloud data is advantageous, which is supported by homomorphic encryption schemes. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) provides a method of performing arbitrary operations directly on encrypted data. This seemingly magical idea is a welcome to cloud computing. However, there are several challenges to overcome for making the technology viable in practical applications. In this paper, we make an initial effort to highlight the problem of translating algorithms that can run on unencrypted or normal data to those which operate on encrypted data. Here, we show that although FHE provides the ability to perform arbitrary computations, its complete benefit can only be obtained if they also allow to execute arbitrary algorithms on encrypted data. In this pursuit, we provide techniques to translate basic operators (like bitwise, arithmetic and relational operators), which are used for implementation of algorithms in any high level language like C. Subsequently, we address decision making and loop handling and related data structures which are vital to realize when the controlling variables are encrypted. Since, termination is a major challenge while handling encrypted data, we propose a method of handling termination by message passing between server and client.",

      "abstract":"Cloud computing is emerging as a viable platform for scientific exploration. Elastic and on-demand access to resources (and other services), the abstraction of “unlimited” resources, and attractive pricing models provide incentives for scientists to move their workflows into clouds. Generalizing these concepts beyond a single virtualized datacenter, it is possible to create federated marketplaces where different types of resources (e.g., clouds, HPC grids, supercomputers) that may be geographically distributed, are collectively exposed as a single elastic infrastructure. This presents opportunities for optimizing the execution of application workflows with heterogeneous and dynamic requirements, and tackling larger scale problems. In this paper, we introduce a framework to manage the end-to-end execution of data-intensive application workflows in dynamic software-defined resource federation. This framework enables the autonomic execution of workflows by elastically provisioning an appropriate set of resources that meet application requirements, and by adapting this set of resources at runtime as the requirements change. It also allows users to customize scheduling policies that drive the way resources federated and used. To demonstrate the benefits of our approach, we study the execution of two different data-intensive scientific workflows in a multi-cloud federation using different policies and objective functions.",

      "abstract":"As real systems become larger and more complex, the use of simulator frameworks grows in our research community. By leveraging them, users can focus on the major aspects of their algorithm, run in-siclo experiments (i.e., simulations), and thoroughly analyze results, even for a large-scale environment without facing the complexity of conducting in-vivo studies (i.e., on real testbeds). Since nowadays the virtual machine (VM) technology has become a fundamental building block of distributed computing environments, in particular in cloud infrastructures, our community needs a full-fledged simulation framework that enables us to investigate large-scale virtualized environments through accurate simulations. To be adopted, such a framework should provide easy-to-use APIs as well as accurate simulation results. In this paper, we present a highly-scalable and versatile simulation framework supporting VM environments. By leveraging SimGrid, a widely-used open-source simulation toolkit, our simulation framework allows users to launch hundreds of thousands of VMs on their simulation programs and control VMs in the same manner as in the real world (e.g., suspend/resume and migrate). Users can execute computation and communication tasks on physical machines (PMs) and VMs through the same SimGrid API, which will provide a seamless migration path to IaaS simulations for hundreds of SimGrid users. Moreover, SimGrid VM includes a live migration model implementing the precopy migration algorithm. This model correctly calculates the migration time as well as the migration traffic, taking account of resource contention caused by other computations and data exchanges within the whole system. This allows user to obtain accurate results of dynamic virtualized systems. We confirmed accuracy of both the VM and the live migration models by conducting several micro-benchmarks under various conditions. Finally, we conclude the article by presenting a first use-case of one consolidation algorithm dealing with a significant number of VMs/PMs. In addition to confirming the accuracy and scalability of our framework, this first scenario illustrates the main interest of SimGrid VM: investigating through in-siclo experiments pros/cons of new algorithms in order to limit expensive in-vivo experiments only to the most promising ones.",

      "abstract":"Recent studies in cloud resource allocation and pricing have focused on computing and storage resources but not network bandwidth. Cloud users nowadays customarily deploy services across multiple geo-distributed datacenters, with significant inter-datacenter traffic generated, paid by cloud providers to ISPs. An effective bandwidth allocation and charging mechanism is needed between the cloud provider and the cloud users. Existing volume based static charging schemes lack market efficiency. This work presents the first dynamic pricing mechanism for inter-data-center on-demand bandwidth, via a Shapley value based auction. Our auction is expressive enough to accept bids as a flat bandwidth rate plus a time duration, or a data volume with a transfer deadline. We start with an offline auction, design an optimal end-to-end traffic scheduling approach, and exploit the Shapley value in computing payments. Our auction is truthful, individual rational, budget balanced and approximately efficient in social welfare. An online version of the auction follows, where decisions are made instantly upon the arrival of each user's realtime transmission demand. We propose an efficient online traffic scheduling algorithm, and approximate the offline Shapley value based payments on the fly. We validate our mechanism design with solid theoretical analysis, as well as trace-driven simulation studies.",

Databases from the Computed Tomographic Colonography (CTC) screening tests among several hospitals are explored. These networked databases are going to be available in the near future via cloud computing technologies. Associated Multiple Databases (AMD) was developed in this study to handle multiple CTC databases. When AMD is used for assembling databases, it can achieve very high classification accuracy. The proposed AMD has the potential to play a role of the core classifier in the cloud computing framework. AMD for multiple institutions databases yields high detection performance of polyps using Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). Two cases in the proposed cloud platform are private and public. We adapted a university cluster as a private platform, and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) as a public. The computation time, memory usage, and running costs were compared using three representative databases between private and public cloud environments. The proposed parallel processing modules improved the computation time, especially in the public cloud environments. The successful development of a cloud computing environment that handles large amounts of data will make Cloud Colonography feasible for a new health care service.",

      "abstract":"The growing importance, large scale, and high server density of high-performance computing datacenters make them prone to attacks, misconfigurations, and failures (of the cooling as well as of the computing infrastructure). Such unexpected events often lead to thermal anomalies - hotspots, fugues, and coldspots - which impact the cost of operation of datacenters. A model-based thermal anomaly detection mechanism, which compares expected (obtained using heat-generation and -extraction models) and observedthermal maps (obtained using thermal cameras) of datacenters, is proposed. In addition, a novel Thermal Anomaly-aware Resource Allocation (TARA) is designed to induce a time-varying thermal fingerprint (thermal map) of the datacenter so to maximize the detection accuracy of the anomalies. As shown via experiments on a small-scale testbed as well as via trace-driven simulations, such model-based thermal anomaly detection solution in conjunction with TARA significantly improves the detection probability compared to anomaly detection when scheduling algorithms such as random, round robin, and best-fit-decreasing are employed.",

      "abstract":"We introduce a new metric for live migration of virtual machines (VM) called eviction time defined as the time to evict the state of one or more VMs from the source host. Eviction time determines how quickly the source can be taken offline or its resources repurposed for other VMs. In traditional live migration, such as pre-copy and post-copy, eviction time equals the total migration time because the source is tied up until the destination receives the entire VM. We present Scatter-Gather live migration which decouples the source and destination during migration to reduce eviction time when the destination is slow. The source scatters the memory of VMs to multiple nodes, including the destination and one or more intermediaries. Concurrently, the destination gathers the VMs' memory from the intermediaries and the source. Thus eviction from the source is no longer bottlenecked by the reception speed of the destination. We support simultaneous live eviction of multiple VMs and exploit deduplication to reduce network overhead. Our Scatter-Gather implementation in the KVM/QEMU platform reduces the eviction time by up to a factor of 6 against traditional pre-copy and post-copy while maintaining comparable total migration time when the destination is slower than the source.",

      "abstract":"Understanding the pattern of end-to-end traffic flows in datacenter networks (DCNs) is essential to many DCN designs and operations (e.g., traffic engineering and load balancing). However, little research work has been done to obtain traffic information efficiently and yet accurately. Researchers often assume the availability of traffic tracing tools (e.g., OpenFlow) when their proposals require traffic information as input, but these tools may have high monitoring overhead and consume significant switch resources even if they are available in a DCN. Although estimating the traffic matrix (TM) between origin-destination pairs using only basic switch SNMP counters is a mature practice in IP networks, traffic flows in DCNs show totally different characteristics, while the large number of redundant routes in a DCN further complicates the situation. To this end, we propose to utilize resource provisioning information in public cloud datacenters and the service placement information in private datacenters for deducing the correlations among top-of-rack switches, and to leverage the uneven traffic distribution in DCNs for reducing the number of routes potentially used by a flow. These allow us to develop ATME as an efficient TM estimation scheme that achieves high accuracy for both public and private DCNs. We compare our two algorithms with two existing representative methods through both experiments and simulations; the results strongly confirm the promising performance of our algorithms.",

This is especially true since essential quality-of-service (QoS) performance metrics such as the UR blocking probability as well as the data center's response time are tightly coupled to such a process. This paper revolves around the proposal of a novel Deadline-Aware UR Scheduling Scheme (DASS) that has the objective of improving the data center's QoS performance in term of the above-mentioned metrics. A minority of existing work in the literature targets the formulation of mathematical models for the purpose of characterizing a cloud data center's performance. As a contribution to covering this gap, this paper presents an analytical model, which is developed for the purpose of capturing the system's dynamics and evaluating its performance when operating under DASS. The model's results' accuracy are verified through simulations. Also, the performance of the data center achieved under DASS is compared to its counterpart achieved under the more generic First-In-First-Out (FIFO) scheme. The reported results indicate that DASS outperforms FIFO by 11 to 58 percent in terms of the blocking probability and by 82 to 89 percent in terms of the system's response time.",

      "abstract":"Although cloud systems provide a reliable and flexible storage solution, the use of a single cloud service constitutes a single point of failure, which can compromise data availability, download speed, and security. To address these challenges, we advocate for the use of multiple cloud storage providers simultaneously using network coding as the key enabling technology. Our goal is to study two challenges of network coded storage systems. First, the efficient update of the number of coded fragments per cloud in a system aggregating multiple clouds in order to boost the download speed of files. We developed a novel scheme using recoding with limited packets to trade-off storage space, reliability, and data retrieval speed. Implementation and measurements with commercial cloud providers show that up to 9x less network use is needed compared to other network coding schemes, while maintaining similar download speeds and reliability. Second, the ability to update coded fragments from a linear erasure code when the original file is modified. We exploit code structure to provide efficient representations of the evolution of the file. Evaluations using file changes on software library repositories show that a five-order of magnitude reduction in network and storage use is possible compared to state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract":"With the advent of cloud computing, more and more people tend to outsource their data to the cloud. As a fundamental data utilization, secure keyword search over encrypted cloud data has attracted the interest of many researchers recently. However, most of existing researches are based on an ideal assumption that the cloud server is “curious but honest”, where the search results are not verified. In this paper, we consider a more challenging model, where the cloud server would probably behave dishonestly. Based on this model, we explore the problem of result verification for the secure ranked keyword search. Different from previous data verification schemes, we propose a novel deterrent-based scheme. With our carefully devised verification data, the cloud server cannot know which data owners, or how many data owners exchange anchor data which will be used for verifying the cloud server's misbehavior. With our systematically designed verification construction, the cloud server cannot know which data owners' data are embedded in the verification data buffer, or how many data owners' verification data are actually used for verification. All the cloud server knows is that, once he behaves dishonestly, he would be discovered with a high probability, and punished seriously once discovered. Furthermore, we propose to optimize the value of parameters used in the construction of the secret verification data buffer. Finally, with thorough analysis and extensive experiments, we confirm the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed schemes.",

      "abstract":"As cloud computing platforms are widely accepted by more and more enterprises and individuals, the underlying cloud workflow systems accumulate large numbers of business process models. Retrieving and recommending the most similar process models according to the tenant's requirements become extremely important, for it is not only beneficial to promote the reuse of the existing model assets, but also helpful to reduce the error rate of the modeling process. Since the scales of cloud workflow repositories become bigger and bigger, developing efficient and exact query approaches is urgent. To this end, an improved two-stage exact query approach based on graph structure is proposed. In the filtering stage, the composite task index, which consists of the label, join-attribute and split-attribute of a task, is adopted to acquire candidate models, which can greatly reduce the number of process models needed to be tested by a time-consuming verification algorithm. In the verification stage, a novel subgraph isomorphism test based on task code is proposed to refine the candidate model set. Experiments are conducted on six synthetic model sets and two real model sets. The results demonstrate that the presented approach can significantly improve the query efficiency and reduce the query response time.",

However, when tasks process big data stored in distributed data centers, the inevitable data movements will cause huge bandwidth cost and execution delay. In this paper, we construct a tripartite graph based model to formulate the data replica placement problem and propose a genetic algorithm based data replica placement strategy for scientific applications to reduce data transmissions in cloud. Our approach can reduce 1) the size of moved data, 2) the time of data movement and 3) the number of movements. We conduct experiments to compare the proposed strategy with the random placement strategy used in Hadoop Distributed Files System (HDFS), which demonstrates that our strategy has better performance for scientific applications in clouds.",

A number of solutions have been proposed to tackle the verification of remote data integrity and retrievability in cloud storage systems. Most of existing schemes, however, do not support efficient data dynamics and/or suffer from security vulnerabilities when involving dynamic data operations. In this paper, we propose a dynamic proof of retrievability scheme supporting public auditability and communication-efficient recovery from data corruptions. To this end, we split up the data into data blocks and encode each data block individually using outer code and inner code before outsourcing so that i) an update inside any data block only affects a few codeword symbols and ii) communication-efficient data repair for a breakdown server can be achieved and communication overhead for small data corruptions within a server can be eliminated. Based on the encoded data blocks, we utilize rb23Tree to enforce the data sequence for dynamic operations, preventing the cloud service provider from manipulating data block to pass the integrity check in the dynamic scenario. Formal security analysis and extensive experimental evaluations are conducted, showing that the proposed scheme is practical for use in cloud storage systems.",

To realize the great flexibility and cost savings, more and more data owners are motivated to outsource their spatio-textual data services to the cloud. However, directly outsourcing such services to the untrusted cloud may arise serious privacy concerns. In this paper, we study the privacy-preserving top-$k$  spatial keyword query problem in untrusted cloud environments. Existing studies primarily focus on the design of privacy-preserving schemes for either spatial or keyword queries, and they cannot be applied to solve the privacy-preserving spatial keyword query problem. To address this problem, we present a novel privacy-preserving top-$k$  spatial keyword query scheme. In particular, we build an encrypted tree index to facilitate privacy-preserving top- $k$  spatial keyword queries, where spatial and textual data are encrypted in a unified way. To search with the encrypted tree index, we propose two effective techniques for the similarity computations between queries and tree nodes under encryption. To improve query performance on large-scale spatio-textual data, we further propose a keyword-based secure pruning method. Thorough analysis shows the validity and security of our scheme. Extensive experimental results on real datasets demonstrate our scheme achieves high efficiency and good scalability.",
